### 2. Explain why using a template is better than creating a document from scratch every time.

Solution: Notion is a powerful productivity tool that helps to create pages for notes, tasks, projects, and more. It helps us to work easily and flexibly.

**REASONS FOR USING TEMPLATES**

- It saves time because you don’t have to recreate the same structure again and again.
- Keeps your pages consistent in InDesign, format, and styles.
- Reduces mistakes since the structure is already prepared.
- Boosts productivity by letting you focus on content instead of formatting.
- Makes team collaboration easier because everyone follows the same layout.
- Reusable and customizable, so you can edit a template once and use it anytime.
- Improves workflow by giving you a ready-made starting point.
